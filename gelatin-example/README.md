gelatin-example
===============

Simple example to get you started with
[gelatin](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gelatin).

This uses [sdl2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sdl2), and the
[gelatin-sdl2](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-sdl2)
bindings, to intialize the window and access events.
